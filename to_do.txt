# ~~ To Do ~~

# Close Proximity view-block dismissals ( FIXED )
# Close proximity objects are not in in_view list, but can cloud up the camera
#   OLD POSSIBLE ERRORS
#       Objects within 1 meter from the point 0,0,0 are not added to the list!
#       May be resolved -- Was just clustering objects
#       Not removing all that is too close
#   SOLUTION:
#       Leave close proximity objects in in_view when finding out what to block
#       Remove after


# Need to block detections that are behind actors ( FIXED )
#   FIXED
#   Solution:
#       Sanitize unpaired physicals before creating new objects
#           Check range and view blockage
#       Logic:
#           If there is a shadow object behind an actor (that may be detected) it will be removed from in_view
#           This will leave its physical unpaired
#           Unpaired physicals are checked to see if
#               they are behind any actors as well.
#               physical is removed if behind an actor
#           Accounts for 2 blockages
#               1) misread - detected object behind an actor that as not there
#               2) see_through - detected object behind an actor that is there
#                   behind obj not updated
#       Future Requirements:
#           detected object get_radius() returns same radius as new object of the same type ( to disallow merging )

# UNRESOLVED:
# Half in view camera objects need separate case -- Not updated, but used in view-block
# Support multiple actors
#   Solution -- Merge only like actors (Done)
#       Pair only like actor types ()
#   Update separately, but include all actors in the view-block dismissal
# Accept views if blocked
# Fix out of min dist polling problem

# CUSTOMIZATION:
# Add measurements to actor settings about object radius
